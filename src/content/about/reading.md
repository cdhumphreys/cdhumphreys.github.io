I flip-flop between sci-fi & fantasy mostly, recently been reading a fair bit of **Adrian Tchaikovsky** (got to love space spiders!) but I will often be found in **Brandon Sanderson**'s latest fantasy work.

Big win for Dune fans recently with the adaptations though the 1984 version still holds a special place in my heart.
