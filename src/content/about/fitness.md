Several times a week you'll find me fighting gravity over heavy objects repeatedly in the **gym**.

I also try to **run** a couple of half marathons a year for the *"fun"* of it (can you tell I don't have kids yet?)

Both do wonders for your mental health as well as your physical - just don't ask me about either or I will try to convince you to run the next half with me.
