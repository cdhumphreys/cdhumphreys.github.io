# My Personal Site
Hi there!

I'm a big fan of Astro's minimal payload and static site bundling abilities. The only thing slowing your site should be the outrageously big banner images (and even those should be compressed and WEBP-ified), not the megabytes of JS. It's my go-to for any static project (or even full-stack since it can run on the server too!).

A lot of the animations use the fantastic [motion](https://motion.dev/docs) library (of Framer Motion fame), which is lightweight and great for scroll animations.
